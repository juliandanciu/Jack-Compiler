# Jack-Compiler

Two-tier compiler as specified in Nand2Tetris (Coursera class). JackCompiler.py compiles a .jack class or directory into virtual machine instructions.
VmTranslator.py compiles a .vm file or directory into assembly language. Finally, Assembler.py takes .asm files and produces machine code.

The target hardware is found in HDL in my Nand2Tetris github folder.
